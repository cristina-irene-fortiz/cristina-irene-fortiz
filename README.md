### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cristina Fortiz!

I'm a passionate problem solver with a blend of cybersecurity expertise and a growing interest in data science.

I enjoy working across a range of technical challenges, from backend logic and designing scalable data architectures to exploring machine learning models. My background in cybersecurity allows me to think deeply about building secure and efficient systems, while my recent dive into data science, AI/ML and big data technologies like Hadoop and Spark keeps my curiosity fueled.

As someone who thrives on learning, Iâ€™m always experimenting with new projectsâ€”whether it's enhancing a Q-learning model for a Nim game or designing data pipelines for real-time analysis. Iâ€™m also excited about combining my security background with my data-driven projects to create impactful solutions. Currently pursuing second master's degree from John Hopkins in CS, focusing on data science.
